	PROMPT
	The fighting pits were uproarious. A steadily quick drumbeat honed an already sharpened crowd, their eyes pointed toward the blood-crusted sandy floor of the arena. Two combatants warily strafing, waiting for that one relevant moment, trying as they might to forget everything else.
	
	You know the dance as well as any. Out of habit, you've already catalogued the ways in which you might kill someone with the objects around you. The chair you sit on wouldn't survive a single strike. The glass mug sitting in front of you, on the other hand, should stay in one piece. It could be more useful broken, anyway. At the table directly behind you, you spot a short-blade attached to someone far too intoxicated.
	
	"I've seen you around," you hear through the noise, shortly before a man drags a chair from an empty table. He takes a labored breath and sits down, placing his mug down. "You've done quite well for yourself."

	<Well>The man makes himself cozy, taking a drink as some spills down his fiery beard. "The name's Arduigh."
	
	He's aged, worn, scarred—perhaps a fighter at some point. His portly figure suggests he lives comfortably in a den where many fight—and likely kill—for rations. The man wipes his beard and lets out a belch. "It's a pleasure to meet you, `ARDUIGH_NFY`."

	"It's clear you aren't from the city. Why you came here isn't important—and where you're from, it's all the same to me—but let me tell you..." Arduigh takes a large swig before looking at you with an unfamiliar sincerity. "As I've said, you've done well for yourself—but it won't last. No one here stays lucky for long."

	Arduigh takes a clumsy swig; a stream of pale-blue mead runs down his beard.

	The bearded, half-drunken man before you takes a moment, as if to relish in the seriousness of this impending information.

	You trip on an easy walk, muttering too long on excuses about why you are, in fact, the way you are. The bearded man smiles cold and dutifully in your general direction.

	The man, without ceremony, disappears from your table and from your sight.
	
	Placing your attention back on the fight, you see one combatant on the backfoot, bleeding from a gash across their bare chest. Their opponent presses the advantage with the taunting rattle of a serrated chain nine-tails. Swinging forward with half-thinking ferocity, the chained tendrils rip into a wooden shield quickly salvaged from a fresh corpse. They try to pull back, but the sharpened chains get stuck. The injured combatant finds an opening, planting their shortblade into their opponent's open left flank, digging deep into their crucial underbelly. 
	
	In a splash of gutteral viscera, the fight is over.

"I *propose* that—before you get yourself gutted—you leave this place and get on with something worth doing." The man's face contorts; he rubs two fingers quizically across his lips, as though he was picking out the perfect weapon in which to kill someone. 
	
	"You don't belong here. This place—this city will leave you without a shred of who you once were." The worn-down face of a well-worried man looks over the railing, down into the fighting pit. "The next one to die might be the luckier."
