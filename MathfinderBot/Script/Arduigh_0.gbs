EVENT::Arduigh
{
	PROMPT
	The fighting pits were uproarious. A steadily quick drumbeat honed an already sharpened crowd—their eyes pointed toward the blood-crusted sandy floor of the arena. Two combatants warily strafe one another, waiting for that one relevant moment, trying as they might to forget everything else.
	
	"I've seen you around," you hear through the noise, shortly before a man drags a chair from an empty table. He takes a labored breath and sits down, placing his mug-of-something down. "You've done quite well for yourself, it seems."
		
	CHOICE
	"That's right." -> Arduigh_0 [Arduigh > 1]
	"Piss off or you'll see me do even better." -> Arduigh_1

	EFFECT
	[Arduigh = "0";]
}
	
EVENT::A_0
{
	PROMPT
	The man makes himself cozy, taking a drink as some spills down his fiery beard. "The name's Arduingh." 
	
	The man appears aged, worn, scarred—perhaps a fighter at some point. His portly figure suggests he lives comfortably in a den where many fight—and possibly kill—for rations. He wipes his beard of ale and lets out a belch.
	
	CHOICE
	"Greetings, Arduigh—what can I do?" -> A_0_0
	Give him your name -> A_0_1
	"Great, now why don't you piss off?" -> A_1
}

EVENT::A_1
{
	PROMPT
	The man's expression flushes. He replies, "Words or weight, you're a tough bastard, aren't ya?" He rubs his chin through a greying beard.
	
	"Figured I'd give you some advice—as you seem to be new to the city—but I can see you aren't interested." He lifts his mug off the table and stands up.

	CHOICE
	Apologize -> Arduigh_1_0 
	"Then say it." -> Arduigh_1_1 
	"..." -> Arduigh_1_2 
	
	EFFECT
	[ARDUIGH_HEART += 1] //this only validates his opinion of you
