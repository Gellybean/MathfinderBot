//You are blindfolded, sitting at the table of a bugman and his comrades. They are fucking with you right now.

EVENT::SLIME
{
	PROMPT [DRANK == 0 ? 1 : 2]
	You're walking down a dirt road. You can't remember where you're going—or why, for that matter—but it feels correct. This is where you're going, and that's that. You'll think no more about it.
	
	It's your mortal integrity that should concern you. You haven't eaten in three days, and the water those travelling bugmen gave you tastes strange. Or, it did—until you kept drinking it.
	
	You feel warm.
	^^
	Good.
	
	CHOICE
	"I look around." -> SEE
	"I keep going." -> GO
	Drink -> DRINK [DRANK > 0] |DRANK = 1|
}

EVENT::SEE [DRANK == 0 ? 1 : 2]
{
	What you see, in fact, is an ocean of tall grass all around you, blood red and shimmering underneath blistering sunlight. The blades whip and bend, paying their respects to an orchestrated concave of towering structures whose tremendous scale—even from this distance—escapes reconciliation.
	
	Sweat beads over your brow.
	^^
	Excellent.
	
	CHOICE
	"Alright. Let's go." -> GO
	"This is weird. What's going on?" -> QUESTION [DRANK < 1]
	"I turn around." -> TURN
	Drink -> SEE [DRANK < 1] |DRANK = 1|

EVENT::QUESTION
{
	PROMPT
	"Indeed. Things may seem strange, but it's importance cannot be overstated. It must be done."

	"An explanation fit for a fool." -> FOOL
	"Why?" -> WHY

}

EVENT::FOOL
{
	PROMPT
	Indeed. You are perhaps at the pinnacle of your personal foolishness, but if it's answers you seek, then you must journey forward."
}

EVENT::WHY
{
	PROMPT
	Why? Hmm...
	
	Perhaps you were so desperate to find out who you were, that you came here—of all places. Because here is where you might find out.
	
	Your stomach continues to growl. You're terribly thirsty. Only one of these things you can help—so why don't you take a drink?
	
	CHOICE
	"I feel fine."
	"No. This can't be real."
	Drink -> WHY [DRANK < 1] |DRANK = 1|

	...Really?

	Ugh.

	Fine. You turn around.

	Continue -> TURN_1_1 [TURN >= 3]
}

EVENT::TURN_1_1
{
	PROMPT
	So. You turn around.
	
	And as you do, the skies twist and turn from their brightly blues into a blaze of orange and red. Clouds of smoke fill the air, choking out the heavens with a silten canopy of ashen dust. The land around you transforms from lush plains to a cracked and roasted hellscape. A sigh of nose-biting sulfuric mist escapes from the earth.
	
	Your eyes water as you take in the heated, rancid air.
	
	CHOICE
	Take a drink. -> DRINK [DRANK > 0] |DRANK = 1|
	"Cool." -> TURN_1_1_0
	"I turn around." -> TURN_1_1_1

	Is this your ideal decision, or have you, more likely, surrendered to your human nature?
