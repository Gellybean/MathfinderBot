# MathfinderBot

Mathfinder is a Discord bot built as a stat-tracker for Pathfinder 1e. Its features include:

- A basic scripting engine you can use to create useful expressions for your character
- Fully customizable statblock that holds all of your variables
- Character sheet imports from other programs (PCGen, Pathbuilder, HeroLabs, Mottokrosh)
- Transform expressions into buttons which you can turn into rows and grids
- Modifiable presets for weapons, armor, beast shapes, and more
- Spell reference with options for calculating values that rely upon caster level.
- Basic inventory management with a large list of built-in items
- Bestiary containing complete entries
- Making your Pathfinder experience more convoluted than ever!


While there are a number of features included with this bot, the main purpose is to make combat easier by accurately tracking numbers for you. When it comes to the typical multitude-of-bonus tracking that Pathfinder is known for, it can be a little confusingâ€”not only because of the number of modifiers, but their bonus types and how they stack. The aim is to make the application and calculation of these modifiers as quick and accurate as possible.
